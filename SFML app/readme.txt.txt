1.Data Structure / Algorithm
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle—much like a line at a ticket counter.
The first element added is the first one to be removed. This behavior makes queues ideal for scenarios where order matters,
such as task scheduling, buffering, and breadth-first search in graphs.

Brief History
The concept of queues dates back to early computing systems, where they were used to manage job scheduling in operating systems.
As programming languages evolved, queues became a fundamental part of many standard libraries, 
reflecting their importance in both theoretical and practical applications.

Purpose & Use Cases
Queues are used to:
- Manage asynchronous data (e.g., print queues, IO buffers)
- Implement algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs
- Control access to shared resources in concurrent systems
- Simulate real-world processes (e.g., customer service lines, traffic systems)


2.Strengths & Weaknesses
Discuss the aspects or characteristics of the DS/A that are good, bad, or somewhere in
between. This is a good section to cover time and space complexity issues. You can reflect
on how the intent of the DS/A aligns with the performance characteristics as to whether it is
an effective tool or not.

3.Real-World Example
List and briefly describe at least one use of your DS/A in a real-world use case.

4.Implementation
Discuss how you implemented the DS/A in code, and how you changed it to be suitable for
visualisation in your project. This is your chance to show your time and effort, and cover
details that you may not have previously. This section and your demo will have significant
overlap – use it to your advantage.
